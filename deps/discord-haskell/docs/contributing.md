### Contributing

The library tries to hide as much detail from the user as reasonable. Lean towards making the library code uglier than the user code. The library does not meet this standard yet, but ideals make hypocrits of us all.

A user should not have to import anything from `Discord.Internal.*` (although they can futz with the internals if they want to)

#### Formatting

Some of the code is moldy, and some is merely old. 

The library is somewhat open to code format style. 
Try to match the formatting of the code around you.
Planning to use ormolu to autoformat the sourcecode eventually 
(see [the formatting tracking issue](https://github.com/aquarial/discord-haskell/issues/87))

When in doubt make it look nice.
